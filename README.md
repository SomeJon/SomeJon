### Hi there, I'm Jonatan Shaya (SomeJon) 👋

🌱 I'm a final-year Computer Science student based near Tel Aviv, Israel, passionate about tackling complex coding challenges.

🚀 My main interests lie in **Machine Learning** and **Object-Oriented Programming**. I enjoy designing robust solutions and exploring the intricacies of software development, particularly on the backend.

💻 My core languages are **Python**, **C#** (.NET), and **Java** (Spring Boot). I leverage Python extensively for its rich Machine Learning ecosystem and for backend development, while I particularly appreciate the strong Object-Oriented design principles found in C# and Java. I also have experience with C++ and C.

💡 I'm a strong believer in meticulous planning *before* writing code. I often create detailed designs and diagrams (using tools like **Draw.io**) to map out architecture and logic, ensuring a solid foundation before implementation begins. I appreciate using **Git** for version control and enjoy exploring concepts like multithreading and multiprocessing.

### 🔭 Projects Showcase

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

* **focus-flow** (Team Project - Python, Flask, PyTorch, GCP)
    * Repos: [Server](https://github.com/The-JAR-Team/focus-flow-server) | [Models](https://github.com/The-JAR-Team/focus-flow-models) | [Client](https://github.com/The-JAR-Team/focus-flow-client)
    * *My Role:* Backend server development (Flask, GCP, PostgreSQL, Docker) and ML model integration (PyTorch, OpenCV, ONNX Runtime, Gemini API).
    * *Goal:* A system to help students improve focus while watching lecture recordings using webcam analysis and AI interaction. (Work in Progress)

* **ModelOptimizer** (Personal Project - Python, OpenAI API)
    * Repo: [https://github.com/SomeJon/ModelOptimizer](https://github.com/SomeJon/ModelOptimizer)
    * *Description:* A client-server system designed to distribute and manage hyperparameter optimization for ML models, using the OpenAI API to intelligently suggest new test configurations. My most loved personal project! (Vision for fully automated distributed training).

* **Machine Learning from Scratch** (Coursework - Python)
    * Repo: [https://github.com/SomeJon/machine-learning-projects](https://github.com/SomeJon/machine-learning-projects)
    * *Description:* Implementations of fundamental ML algorithms (Neural Networks for MNIST/Medical Data, Perceptron, Linear/Logistic Regression, SVM) without relying on high-level libraries like Scikit-learn's model classes.

* **Facebook Client** (Course Assignment - C#, WinForms)
    * Repo: [https://github.com/SomeJon/C24-Design-FacebookClient](https://github.com/SomeJon/C24-Design-FacebookClient)
    * *Description:* A desktop client application interacting with the Facebook API using WinForms. Employs a "stupid client" architecture and various design patterns (Proxy, Adapter, Singleton, etc.). (Primarily solo work).

* **JavaCodeNames** (Course Assignment - Java, Tomcat)
    * Repo: [https://github.com/SomeJon/JavaCodeNames](https://github.com/SomeJon/JavaCodeNames)
    * *Description:* A console-based, networked implementation of the Codenames board game featuring a Tomcat server, room management, chat, and full game logic. (Solo work, ~110 hours).

* **Hospital System** (Early Course Assignment - C++)
    * Repo: [https://github.com/Quercusoak/Hospital](https://github.com/Quercusoak/Hospital)
    * *Description:* My first significant C++ project (pair work), implementing a basic management system for a hospital.
